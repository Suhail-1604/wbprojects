    years. They have retractable claws, excellent night vision, and unique skeletal features that enable agility and
    balance. Cats communicate through vocalizations and body language, purring when content and hissing when threatened.

    care, nutrition, exercise, and mental stimulation are crucial for their health, with an average lifespan of 12 to 18
    years. Cats have held cultural significance in various societies, and their playful behaviors and expressions have made
    them internet sensations in recent years.</p>
